## 📝 StickyDesk – A Minimal Desktop Sticky Notes App

### 💡 Inspiration

We were inspired by the simplicity and effectiveness of classic sticky notes applications. Many people rely on these lightweight tools for jotting quick thoughts, todos, and reminders—but modern solutions often feel bloated, overly styled, or lack basic multi-window functionality. We wanted to bring back the essence of old-school stickies with a modern developer stack, optimized for speed and multitasking.

### 🛠️ How We Built It

We built **StickyDesk** using **React** with an Electron wrapper to target the desktop environment. Our main goals were:

* **Text Wrapping:** Ensuring note content dynamically adjusts with the window size.
* **Multi-Instance Support:** Users can create multiple sticky note windows independently.
* **Lightweight UX:** Fast load time, minimal clutter, and intuitive design.
* **State Management:** Each note maintains its content as long as the window remains open.

Key technologies and tools used:

* ⚛️ React
* 🖥️ Electron
* 🧠 useState and useEffect for dynamic content
* 📦 Vite for fast build and hot reload

### 🚧 Challenges We Faced

* **Multi-window support:** React isn’t built for multi-window desktop apps by default. We had to integrate Electron’s `BrowserWindow` API with care to allow new instances to spawn with isolated React states.
* **Persistent text management:** Balancing simplicity with functionality meant deciding not to overcomplicate with a database or filesystem writes, while still avoiding accidental data loss within open sessions.
* **Window resize and responsiveness:** Making sure text wraps fluidly in a resizable window without breaking layout or overflow required custom CSS tuning and dynamic measurements.

### 📚 What We Learned

* How to combine React and Electron to build real desktop experiences
* Managing state across multiple windows in a React app
* Handling native-like window behavior (resize, drag, close) with a web tech stack
* Prioritizing user simplicity while maintaining technical performance
